Sfq queue disc
------------------

This chapter describes the Sfq ([1]_) queue disc implementation in |ns3|.

The Stochastic Fair Queuing (SFQ) algorithm is a Queue Management algorithm.
SFQ is an attempt to distribute network usage fairly among different 
source-destination pairs of messages. For absolute fairness, a hash 
between a source-destination pair and a queue is created, and round-robin 
is employed among the queues. However, this consumes a lot of resources and 
is not practical. Stochastic Fair Queueing employs an approxiate hash, which 
is more viable. The hash function is perturbed periodically to maintain 
fairness. Each queue is served according to its current allotment, a positive 
allotment means that the queue may be served, if it is next in order, while a 
negative allotment means that the next queue in the list should be taken.

Model Description
*****************

The source code for the Sfq queue disc is located in the directory
``src/traffic-control/model`` and consists of 2 files `sfq-queue-disc.h`
and `sfq-queue-disc.cc` defining a SfqQueueDisc class and a helper
SfqFlow class. The code was ported to |ns3| based on Linux kernel code
implemented by Alexey Kuznetsov as well as the ns-2 code for Sfq.

* class :cpp:class:`SfqQueueDisc`: This class implements the main Sfq algorithm:

  * ``SfqQueueDisc::DoEnqueue ()``: This routine uses the configured packet filters to classify the given packet into an appropriate queue. If the filters are unable to classify the packet, the packet is added to a spare queue. If the queue is an empty slot, it is added to the end of the list of queues, and its allotment is initialized to the configured quantum. Otherwise, the queue is left in its current queue list. In ns-2 mode, a quantum is not allocated. In case the queue is already full, or the number of remaining number of slots is less than the number of queues, and the current queue has already exceeded its allocated space (which is given by total limit / number of queues), then the incoming packet is dropped.

  * ``SfqQueueDisc::DoDequeue ()``: In the case of ns-2 mode, the first packet in the queue at the front of the round robin is removed and returned. If the queue still has remaining packets, it is removed from the front of the round robin and placed at the end. In the case of default execution, the first task performed is selecting a queue from which to dequeue a packet. The scheduler looks at the front of the list, if the current queue has a negative allotment, its allotment is increased by quantum and sent to the back. Otherwise, that queue is selected for dequeue. After having selected a queue from which to dequeue a packet, the fifo algorithm is invoked on that queue. If the fifo algorithm does not return a packet, then the queue must be empty, and the scheduler removes it from the list, marking it as an unused slot to be added back (as a new queue) the next time a packet for that queue arrives. Then (since no packet was available for dequeue), the whole dequeue process is restarted from the beginning. If, instead, the scheduler did get a packet back from the fifo algorithm, it subtracts the size of the packet from the byte allotment for the selected queue and returns the packet as the result of the dequeue operation.

* class :cpp:class:`SfqFlow`: This class implements a flow queue, by keeping its current status (an empty slot, or in use) and its current allotment.

In Linux, by default, packet classification is done by hashing (using a 
Jenkins hash function) and taking the hash value modulo the number of queues.
The hash is salted by modulo addition of a random value selected at regular 
intervals, in order to perturb the hash function, reducing the chances of 
the same collision consistently occuring. Alternatively, any other packet 
filter can be configured. In the ns-2 version, the hashing is done manually 
without perturb using the formula (k + (k >> 8) + ~(k >> 4)) % ((2 << 19) - 1)
where k is the sum of addresses of source and destination in integer format.
In |ns3|, at least one packet filter must be added to an Sfq queue disc.

Attributes
==========

The key attributes that the SfqQueue class holds include the following:

* ``MaxSize:`` The limit on the maximum number of packets stored by Sfq.
* ``Flows:`` The number of flow queues managed by Sfq.
* ``Ns2Impl:`` If enabled uses ns-2 implementation of SFQ.
* ``FlowLimit:`` The limit on number of packets each flow can hold.

Note that the quantum, i.e., the number of bytes each queue gets to dequeue on
each round of the scheduling algorithm, is set by default to the MTU size of 
the device (at initialisation time). The ``SfqQueueDisc::SetQuantum ()`` method
can be used (at any time) to configure a different value. Quantum is unused if 
ns-2 implementation is followed.

Examples
========

A typical usage pattern is to create a traffic control helper and to 
configure type and attributes of queue disc and filters from the helper. 
For example, Sfq can be configured as follows:

.. sourcecode:: cpp

  TrafficControlHelper tch;
  uint16_t handle = tch.SetRootQueueDisc ("ns3::SfqQueueDisc");
  tch.AddPacketFilter (handle, "ns3::SfqIpv4PacketFilter", "PerturbationTime", UintegerValue (100));
  tch.AddPacketFilter (handle, "ns3::SfqIpv6PacketFilter", "PerturbationTime", UintegerValue (100));
  QueueDiscContainer qdiscs = tch.Install (devices);

Validation
**********

The Sfq model is tested using :cpp:class:`SfqQueueDiscTestSuite` class defined in `src/traffic-control/test/sfq-queue-disc-test-suite.cc`.  The suite includes 10 test cases:

* Test 1: The first test checks that packets that cannot be classified by any available filter are added to a unique flow.
* Test 2: The second test checks that IPv4 packets having distinct destination addresses are enqueued into different flow queues, and that the flows correctly drop packets when limits are reached. It also ensures dequeuing from an empty queue returns 0.
* Test 3: The third test checks that TCP packets with distinct destination addresses are enqueued into different flow queues.
* Test 4: The fourth test checks that UDP packets with distinct destination addresses are enqueued into different flow queues.
* Test 5: The fifth test checks the dequeue operation and the deficit round robin-based scheduler.
* Test 6: The sixth test checks that similar packets are enqueued into different flows after the perturbation time is reached.
* Test 7: The seventh test checks for ns-2 style implementation that packets that cannot be classified by any available filter are added to a unique flow.
* Test 8: The eighth test checks for ns-2 style implementation that IPv4 packets having distinct destination addresses are enqueued into different flow queues, and that the flows correctly drop packets when limits are reached. It also ensures dequeuing from an empty queue returns 0.
* Test 9: The ninth test checks for ns-2 style implementation that TCP packets with distinct destination addresses are enqueued into different flow queues.
* Test 10: The tenth test checks for ns-2 style implementation that UDP packets with distinct destination addresses are enqueued into different flow queues.

The test suite can be run using the following commands::

  $ ./waf configure --enable-examples --enable-tests
  $ ./waf build
  $ ./test.py -s sfq-queue-disc

or::

  $ NS_LOG="SfqQueueDisc" ./waf --run "test-runner --suite=sfq-queue-disc"
